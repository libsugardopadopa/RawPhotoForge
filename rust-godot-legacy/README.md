## Building

RawPhotoForge Desktop consists of:

* A core implemented in Rust
* A Godot-based UI using GDExtension

The following instructions describe how to build the project from source on Linux.

### Requirements

* Rust
* Cargo
* Godot Engine (standard version, .NET version not required)
* Linux (tested on x86_64)

### Build Steps

```bash
git clone https://github.com/libsugardopadopa/RawPhotoForge.git
cd RawPhotoForge/rust-godot-legacy

cargo build -r -p photo-editor-godot
cargo about init
cargo about generate about.hbs > rust_licenses.html
mkdir ./raw-photo-forge/addons/photo_editor/libs
mkdir ./raw-photo-forge/addons/photo_editor/libs/Linux-x86_64
cp ./target/release/libphoto_editor_godot.so ./raw-photo-forge/addons/photo_editor/libs/Linux-x86_64/libphoto_editor_godot.so
```

### Exporting with Godot

1. Open `rust-godot-legacy/raw-photo-forge/` as a project in Godot.
2. Verify that the GDExtension is loaded correctly.
3. Use Godot's export feature to generate application binaries.
